# booksearch
DockerHub image repository: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rgb234/book_search/general <br></br>
This Flutter project is using Naver OpenAPI and was created to test client-server architecture \
This Flutter App sends HTTP request to the server which is implemented by the 'book_api' code in my repository (lib/api/books_api.dart) \
and 'book_api' calls Naver OpenAPI\
